# Monte Carlo Integration Simulations

This is a simple simulation that randomly places points on a map image and uses color data to determine whether the point falls on a lake.

The simulation is set up so that 100 points are placed each second. The number of points that hit the lake and the total number of points dropped are updated each second.

The basic algorithm for these simulations and the image were provided by [Jeong Seungah](email:1708011290@wya.top) and implemented by [Richard Ambler](email:rambler@ibwya.net), 26 October 2018.

The simulations can be [performed here](https://monte-carlo-simulations-beijing-lake.netlify.com/) and the [code can be viewed here](https://github.com/ram6ler/monte-carlo-sims/blob/master/web/main.dart).

Enjoy!
